			To think is easy. To act is difficult. To act as one thinks is the most difficult of all. We can try to avoid making choices by doing nothing, but even that is a decision. You do not have to be a fantastic hero to do certain things, to compete. You can be just an ordinary chap, sufficiently motivated to reach challenging goals. If you do not do it excellently, do not do it at all. Because if it is not excellent, it will not be profitable or fun, and if you are not in business for fun or profit, what the hell are you doing there? You cannot pick cherries with your back to the tree.
			The wisest men follow their own direction. Nothing is so exhausting as indecision, and nothing is so futile. Begin difficult things while they are easy. A thousand-mile journey begins with one step. Have no fear of perfection you will never reach it. Do not compromise yourself. You are all you have got. The first two letters of the word goal spell go. Do not be afraid to take big steps. You cannot cross a chasm in two small jumps. Why not go out on a limb? That is where the fruit is
			If you have a lemon, make lemonade. Normal is not something to aspire to, it is something to get away from. Nothing comes from doing nothing. Your self-beliefs either support or undermine you. Begin difficult things while they are easy. A thousand-mile journey begins with one step. There is a time for departure even when there is no certain place to go. What lies before us and what lies beyond us is tiny compared to what lies within us. Remember, a dead fish can float downstream, but it takes a live one to swim upstream.

		And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. With our thoughts we make the world. Never bend your head, always hold it high. Look the world straight in the face. Who looks outside, dreams who looks inside, awakes. Listen to the silence as it echoes around you. Ancient spirits dance to it. The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity, and execute with vigor, to sketch out a map of possibilities and then to treat them as probabilities. We outgrow people, places, and things as we unfold. We may be saddened when old friends say their piece and leave our lives... but let them go. They were at a different stage and looking in a different direction
		How soon will you realise that the only thing you do not have is the direct experience that there is nothing you need that you do not have? There are times when a man should be content with what he has, but never with what he is. What would it be like if you lived each day, each breath, as a work of art in progress? Imagine that you are a Masterpiece unfolding, every second of every day a work of art taking form with every breath. The rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a mans foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher. I expect to pass through this world but once. Any good therefore that I can do, or any kindness or abilities that I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now. Let me not defer it or neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again. One important key to success is selfconfidence. An important key to selfconfidence is preparation. Do noble things, do not dream them all day long. Always know in your heart that you are far bigger than anything that can happen to you.
		A man does not have to be an angel in order to be saint. It is better to die for something than to live for nothing. Our awesome responsibility to ourselves, to our children, and to the future is to create ourselves in the image of goodness, because the future depends on the nobility of our imaginings. The best cure for worry, depression, melancholy, brooding, is to go deliberately forth and try to lift, with sympathy, the gloom of somebody else. The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity, and execute with vigor, to sketch out a map of possibilities and then to treat them as probabilities. Dwell in possibility. A mind is like a canvas: The more open your mind, The more colors you can use. O Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding I consider it as difficult to subdue as the wind.
		As you think, you travel, and as you love, you attract. You are today where your thoughts have brought you you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you. The way is not in the sky. The way is in the heart. Our awesome responsibility to ourselves, to our children, and to the future is to create ourselves in the image of goodness, because the future depends on the nobility of our imaginings. With my freckles and messy hair, bruised knee and chapped lips this morning I am splendidly imperfect and alive! One important key to success is selfconfidence. An important key to selfconfidence is preparation.
